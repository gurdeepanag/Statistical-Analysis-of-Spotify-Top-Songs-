# Top Streaming Songs Spotify

### Introduction
Our project endeavors to delve into the realm of Spotify’s top-performing songs in 2023, seeking to analyze and statistically evaluate a series of specific inquiries crafted within the context of this dataset.
Stemming from the desire to put into practice the diverse array of techniques we have acquired throughout the course of this semester, we constructed guiding questions that would enable us to do so. This encompassed the application of statistical tools such as bootstrap simulations, Student’s t-test, permutation test, proportion test, chi-squared test, and linear regression, in order to derive definitive answers and ascertain whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
To guide our investigation, we have articulated three key questions that piqued our collective curiosity:
Our first intriguing insight we sought out to determine, was if songs featuring multiple artists garner greater popularity when compared to solo artist compositions. This inquiry led us to create two distinct samples by categorizing songs into either a “single artist” or “multiple artist” category. We achieved this by introducing a new categorical variable, “has_multiple_artist,” which systematically categorized each song in our dataset. The parameter we would utilize in our comparison would be the mean value of streams for each of these populations.
Our second line of inquiry revolved around investigating whether the proportion of songs with high speechiness (defined as ≥20%, based on the distribution of speechiness) was more prevalent in songs with multiple artists as opposed to those with solo artists. To address this, we introduced a binary column labeled “speechiness_category,” which assigned a value of 1 to songs with high speechiness and 0 to songs with low speechiness.
Finally, we set out to uncover any interrelationships among the seven Spotify metrics themselves, with the intention of representing them through a linear model estimate. To accomplish this, we developed a scatter matrix to identify the possible correlations with strong linear associations within the pairings of these metrics.

### Dataset
The dataset we have retrieved is from Kaggle (Elgiriyewithana, 2023) and is in a structured, tabular format (.csv file), with rows representing songs and columns representing different variables of the songs. This dataset was collected for the year of 2023 starting from January 1, 2023 to August 26, 2023.
This dataset was retrieved by the publisher leveraging the digital music streaming platform’s API such as Spotify’s Web API. It is due to this, that the dataset was able to include Spotify proprietary metrics. There is no behind-the-scenes access that would enable us to discover how these metrics were calculated, as it is within the realm of intellectual property and is patented. We have permission to use this dataset in alignment with a Creative Commons License which allows us to use, share, and adapt the dataset for our educational purposes.

### Guiding Questions

Guiding Questions:

1. Does the data indicate that songs featuring multiple artists have more streams than solo artist songs?

2. From the data, can we infer that songs featuring multiple artists have greater proportion of high speechiness songs (≥20%) than solo artists?

3. Is there a linear relationship amongst any of the seven Spotify proprietary metrics?
     
### Conclusion

In conclusion, our data exploration and analysis have unveiled essential findings and insights within the realm of Spotify's top-performing songs in 2023, guided by our three fundamental questions. For our first question, the results of our hypothesis testing led to an intriguing revelation: we could not reject the null hypothesis, indicating that, on average, solo songs appeared to have stream counts equal to or surpassing those featuring two or more artists. This finding highlights the intriguing possibility that multiple artists may not guarantee a higher stream count, potentially reshaping how we perceive the success of solo artist songs and multi-artist collaborations. In response to our second question, the data and statistical tests have provided compelling evidence. Songs with multiple artists, on average, tend to exhibit a higher proportion of high speechiness scores compared to songs with a single artist. While our analysis demonstrates a correlation, the complex dynamics of causation may warrant further exploration. Our examination of the seven Spotify proprietary metrics, as addressed in our third question, has brought to light a notable negative linear relationship between acousticness and energy. Our rigorous assessment of underlying assumptions, including normality of residuals and homoscedasticity, confirms the reliability of our linear model. The results of the F-test further underscore the statistical significance of our model, affirming the influential role of 'acousticness' on 'energy.' Finally, our heatmap correlation analysis identified a single robust relationship among the metrics examined. As we reflect on these discoveries, we recognize the profound complexity and diversity of top-streaming music in today's world. Our exploration of multi-artist collaborations, the intricacies of Spotify's audio metrics, and the acknowledgement for external factors to influence song performance prompts us to envision a wealth of untapped possibilities in the field of music analysis. We believe that research in this field could explore the influence of external factors such as marketing strategies, artist popularity, or cultural events on the streaming performance of songs. Further investigation into the dynamic nature of success on streaming platforms and its impact on artists' decision-making processes could provide invaluable insights for the music industry. Our journey into the world of data-driven music insights has just begun, and we eagerly anticipate the path ahead, teeming with opportunities for deeper exploration and ground-breaking discoveries.
